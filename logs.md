1.3 Neoforge!

# Fight Styles on NeoForge!

Now that the mod got some fixes, I think it would be good to add this to NeoForge. NeoForge has 1.20.6 while Forge only has 1.20.1. I want you all to have the most recent updates. 1.21.1 will sadly need to wait. I use MCreator to make mods and their updates are a bit.. **sluggish...** Thank you for your understanding, and happy fighting!
